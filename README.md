# Project goal: 

The TikTok data team is developing a machine learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform.

## Background: 

TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. The platform is built to help imaginations thrive. TikTok's mission is to create a place for inclusive, joyful, and authentic content–where people can safely discover, create, and connect.

## Scenario: 

As a data analyst on TikTok's data team, you'll help by preparing the data needed for the claims classification project. You’ll build a dataframe, organize the claims data for the process of exploratory data analysis, and update the team on your progress and insights.

## Tasks:

* Build a dataframe for the TikTok dataset

* Read in data from TikTok csv file

* Display rows within dataframe

* Examine data type of each column

* Gather descriptive statistics

* Visualize the TikTok data in Python

* Report to TikTok’s data team through an executive summary

**_Note:_** *The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this project are fictitious. No identification with actual persons (living or deceased) is intended or should be inferred. And, the data shared in this project has been created for pedagogical purposes.*
